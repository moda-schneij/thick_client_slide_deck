## Best practices

- Keep component and directive controller classes lean <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Rely on services to handle the majority of an application's logic, to fetch and persist data, and to manage state <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Keep services and service methods focused (single responsibility) and testable <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
  - Practice TDD: write test cases before code <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
