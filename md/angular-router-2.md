## Router features

- Can "guard" routes according to business rules (e.g., authentication) <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->
- Can "resolve" to wait for asynchronous data before completing routes <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->
- Can lazily load entire modules with sets of feature components and services, helping to make initial application payload leaner <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" -->
